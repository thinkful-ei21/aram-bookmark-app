Notse: The first few hours were spent on my design, and a lack of hands on experience with HTML/CSS caused me to fumble in the beginning. Working throughout the first day, I got most of the features built, just needing to be integrated with the API. An overzealous attitute caused me to lose hours of work on the first night, not structuring things properly and breaking my app. This morning was spent fixing the issues and hooking up the api properly, and integrating prebuilt functions. The functions I built were not compatible with what I needed, so tweaking was used. Failure to properly prepare these features for integration cost me valuable time and caused me to sloppily put together my scripts and markup, while losing the oppurtinity to restructure before submission. My primary motivation in the last hours were to make sure that the app worked on the client side, sacrificing how things are structured on the developer side.

Going into my next project, I have made mistakes in building from scratch in this app that will help me structure better from the ground up next time, building a proper responsive app, adhering to all guidelines.
